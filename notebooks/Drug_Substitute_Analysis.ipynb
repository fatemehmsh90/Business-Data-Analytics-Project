        "\n",
        "## **1.1\tBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY**\n",
        "Drug shortage is an important problem in the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a medicine is not available in the market, patients and doctors need to find a substitute drug.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is often slow and manual, and people usually look only at the active ingredient.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this is not enough because medicines can be different in their chemical structure, mechanism of action, and therapeutic class.\n",
        "\n",
        "If these differences are not considered, the chosen substitute may not work well and can cause treatment delays or higher costs (Aronson et al., 2023a; Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many reasons for drug shortages, such as production problems, dependency on one manufacturer, and weak distribution systems. These problems hurt patients and put pressure on the healthcare system (Andy A. and Andy D., 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, data-driven approaches have been used more often to support decision-making. Using data science and combining it with artificial intelligence, these methods can find patterns faster and help select better substitutes (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "For text information about drugs, embedding methods can also be used to understand meaning and measure similarity between medicines (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "This study aims to build a data-driven approach for identifying substitute medicines. This study try to combine textual and structural features to calculate similarities and provide results that can help pharmaceutical supply company managers make better and faster decisions. (Aronson et al., 2023b; Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.2\tPROBLEM STATEMENT**\n",
        "Today, there is no simple and data-based system that can automatically find substitute medicines. Pharmacists and doctors often decide only by reading the drug information or by using their own experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process takes time and sometimes gives wrong results, because it only looks at the active ingredient and ignores other important details like chemical structure, mechanism of action, and therapeutic class (Aronson et al., 2023a; Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "\n",
        "When drug shortages become more common, quick and correct decisions are very important. However, many countries and companies still use basic or manual tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent studies show that machine learning and data analytics can help to find hidden patterns and possible drug substitutes that support better decision-making in the pharmaceutical supply chain (Iyer, 2025; Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, there is no research that brings both textual and structured features together for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the main problem of this study is:\n",
        "\n",
        "how to combine textual data (like product descriptions) and structured data (like therapeutic class, chemical structure, and mechanism of action) to predict possible substitute medicines, and how to use these results for better business and supply chain decisions (Iyer, 2025; Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.3\tRESEARCH AIM AND OBJECTIVES**\n",
        "**Research Aim:**  \n",
        "The main aim of this study is to build a data-driven method that can find substitute medicines in a more accurate way.\n",
        "To do this, the study combines two types of information:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tText information from drug descriptions, and\n",
        "2.\tStructured information such as therapeutic class, chemical structure, and mechanism of action.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using both types of data together, the study tries to understand which medicines are similar and which ones can be used as substitutes during a drug shortage.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Research Objectives:**  \n",
        "- Create text embeddings for the drug descriptions to understand meaning and similarity (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "- Encode the structured features of each drug (Therapeutic / Chemical / Action classes).\n",
        "- Combine text and structured features to calculate similarity between medicines.\n",
        "- Identify the Top-k substitute drugs for each medicine.\n",
        "- Apply clustering and build a substitution network.\n",
        "- Create two indicators: SI (Substitutability Index) and SRI (Shortage Risk Index) for business analysis.\n",
        "- Validate the results using an external dataset (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "These objectives help the study create a method that is both technically strong and useful for real decision-making in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.4\tRESEARCH QUESTIONS**\n",
        "This study is guided by several research questions that help to give a clear direction to the project and show what the analysis aims to answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RQ1:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Does combining text data (such as drug descriptions) and structured data (such as therapeutic class, chemical structure, and mechanism of action) improve the accuracy of finding substitute medicines?\n",
        "\n",
        "This question will be addressed by studies that show how different drug properties can influence decisions to substitute drugs for each other. (Aronson et al., 2023a; Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "\n",
        "**RQ2:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Which therapeutic classes have the highest substitutability, and which ones have the lowest substitutability?\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important question between all questions in pharmaceutical supply chains that must be answered because some drug groups are more sensitive to shortages than others. (Andy A. and Andy D., 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "**RQ3:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Can the substitution index (SI) and the shortage risk index (SRI) help describe the risk level of different drug groups in a simple and useful way?\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be supported by the idea of data-driven decisions in the supply chain. (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "**RQ4:**\n",
        "\n",
        "How can the results of this model support real decisions in procurement and the pharmaceutical supply chain?\n",
        "\n",
        "This question focuses on the practical value of the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.5\tSCOPE & SIGNIFICANCE**\n",
        "**Scope:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, I use the MID dataset as the main data source.\n",
        "This dataset includes information such as drug name, text description, therapeutic class, chemical class, and mechanism of action.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis is limited to these fields. I do not use price data, sales data, or patient-level data. The main focus is to see if these text and structured fields are enough to suggest possible substitute medicines.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the results more reliable, I also plan to use an external dataset for checking the model, for example a public medicine substitute dataset from Kaggle or a similar source.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project does not go deep into company finance or detailed cost modelling, but the results can still be useful for pharmacy managers and supply chain planners (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Drug shortages are a real and growing problem in many countries.\n",
        "They can delay treatment and create stress for patients, doctors and pharmacists (Aronson et al., 2023a). In many places, the current tools for finding substitutes are slow, manual, or not updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "A data-driven method that can suggest substitutes faster and in a more structured way may help to reduce delays and improve access to medicines (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "By using text embeddings and structured features together, the model does not rely only on the active ingredient or the drug name, but also on therapeutic class, chemical properties and mechanism of action (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this study can be a small but useful step towards smarter tools for managing the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.6 OVERVIEW OF ANALYTICAL APPROACH**\n",
        "This study follows a clear and step-by-step analytical process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to combine text information and structured drug features to build a method that can suggest substitute medicines and help understand shortage risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step is to look at the data and understand its basic shape.\n",
        "In the first review, I examine the number of drugs, missing values, and distribution of treatment categories in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps me see if the data needs cleaning and what patterns appear at the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: Text Embeddings**\n",
        "\n",
        "The text descriptions of each drug are turned into numerical vectors using embedding methods. These vectors help the model understand the meaning of the text better(Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Structured Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, we will convert therapeutic classes, chemical classes, and mechanisms of action into numerical values. These features are of great importance because they show us how drugs can be related in terms of therapeutics and properties or chemical formulas(Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4: Combining Text and Structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "The text embeddings and structured features are merged to create a full representation of each drug.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 5: Similarity Calculation**\n",
        "\n",
        "For every drug, similarity to other drugs is calculated using cosine similarity.\n",
        "This helps identify possible substitute medicines.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 6: Clustering and Substitution Network**\n",
        "\n",
        "Drugs that are similar are grouped together.\n",
        "This network is then displayed as a graph to show how the drug ingredients are related and which groups have stronger substitution bonds with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 7: Model Evaluation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The results are checked using an external dataset.\n",
        "Metrics such as Hit@k and Precision@k are used to see how well the method finds correct substitutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 8: Business Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, two indicators are created:\n",
        "\n",
        "**•\tSI (Substitutability Index)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**•\tSRI (Shortage Risk Index)**\n",
        "\n",
        "These two indicators help decision-makers in the pharmaceutical supply chain to better understand which drug groups have good alternatives and which groups face higher prices (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach makes the analysis technically strong and also useful for real decision-making in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1.7 STRUCTURE OF THE DISSERTATION**\n",
        "This dissertation is divided into several parts.\n",
        "In first Chapter it gives us an introduction to the topic. It explains the problem, the aim of the study, the research questions, and the general analytical approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chapter Two presents the literature review.\n",
        "This chapter describes drug shortages, substitution patterns, data analytics methods, similarity techniques, text embeddings, and how these tools can be used in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n",

        "Chapter Three explains the research methodology.\n",
        "It introduces the MID dataset and describes the steps for data cleaning, text embedding, encoding structured features, and calculating similarity.\n",

        "\n",
        "Chapter Seven provides business insights.\n",
        "It explains the SI (Substitutability Index) and SRI (Shortage Risk Index) and shows how the results can support decisions in procurement and supply chain planning.\n",

        "# **CHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW**\n",
        "## **2.1 DRUG SHORTAGES: DEFINITIONS, CAUSES, IMPACTS**\n",
        "Drug shortages are a serious problem in many countries. According to Aronson et al. (2023a), a drug shortage happens when a medicine is not available for patients at the time they need it. Shortages can be short or long, and they can affect the quality of treatment and patient safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many causes why drug shortages occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aronson et al. (2023b) explain that problems in manufacturing, lack of raw materials, quality control issues, dependence on a single supplier, strict import rules, and distribution problems are some of the main reasons. Sometimes companies reduce production because the profit of a drug is low. In other cases, transportation delays or global crises create disruptions in the supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "A review article by Adak (2024) shows that drug shortages not only create technical problems but also serious human problems. Shortages can increase treatment costs, delay therapy, and create stress for patients, doctors, and pharmacists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adak (2024) also notes that shortages reduce trust in the healthcare system and make daily work in pharmacies more difficult. Another study by Andy and Andy (2023) explains that the current systems used by pharmacies to find substitute medicines are slow and limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many places, pharmacists decide based only on the active ingredient. This can be risky because two drugs with the same active ingredient can still have very different chemical structures, mechanisms of action, or therapeutic classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of these challenges, recent research suggests that healthcare systems should use more data-driven tools and smarter methods to support substitution decisions. These tools can help make faster and more accurate choices and reduce the negative impacts of shortages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2.2 MEDICINE SUBSTITUTION: CONCEPTS & CHALLENGES**\n",
        "Medicine substitution means using another medicine when the original one is not available. According to Aronson et al. (2023b), substitution can happen for many reasons, such as a drug shortage, high price, production problems, or a change in the treatment plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two common types of substitution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1) Generic substitution**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the original medicine is replaced with a generic version that has the same active ingredient. This method is widely used, but it is not always enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if two medicines have the same active ingredient, they may still have different chemical structures or mechanisms of action\n",
        "(Aronson et al., 2023a).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Therapeutic substitution**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the medicine is replaced with another medicine that has a different active ingredient but a similar therapeutic effect. This type of substitution is more complex and requires deeper pharmaceutical knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Studies show that finding the right substitute is not always easy. One major challenge is that information sources are often old or incomplete (Andy & Andy, 2023). In many countries, pharmacists must search manually through different websites or books to find similar medicines. This takes time and may lead to mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another problem is that similarity between medicines is not only about the active ingredient.\n",
        "\n",
        "A safe and correct substitution should consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "- chemical structure\n",
        "\n",
        "- mechanism of action\n",
        "\n",
        "- therapeutic class\n",
        "\n",
        "- side effects\n",
        "\n",
        "- drug interactions\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of these challenges, recent research recommends using data-driven tools and machine learning methods to support substitution decisions (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "These tools can combine text and structured data and suggest substitute medicines faster and more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2.3\tDATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES IN HEALTHCARE & SUPPLY CHAIN**\n",
        "In recent years, data-driven methods have become more common in healthcare and in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iyer (2025) explains that data-driven decision making can reduce errors, improve planning, and make operations faster. Many countries now try to use data to predict drug shortages, manage purchasing, and find substitute medicines more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data-driven approaches often include several basic steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "collecting data, cleaning the data, exploring it with simple analysis, building machine learning models, and creating dashboards or reports for decision-makers. These steps help doctors, pharmacists, and managers make choices based on real information instead of guesswork.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some studies use machine learning models to predict drug shortages or supply risks. Other studies use clustering methods to group similar medicines together and find patterns in drug usage (Adak, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques can help identify which drug groups are more sensitive to shortages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data-driven methods are especially important in the pharmaceutical supply chain because:\n",
        "\n",
        "- drug shortages are increasing\n",
        "\n",
        "- large amounts of data are available\n",
        "\n",
        "- traditional systems are slow\n",
        "\n",
        "- managers need smarter tools for planning\n",
        "\n",
        "A study by Andy and Andy (2023) shows that many current systems for finding substitute medicines are old, slow, and often incomplete. This makes it difficult for pharmacists to make fast and accurate decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "More advanced techniques, such as text embeddings and similarity search, are now being used in healthcare (Kauffman et al., 2025). These methods help computers understand the meaning of drug descriptions and find medicines that are truly similar based on both text and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, research shows that data-driven tools can increase speed, reduce mistakes, and improve decision-making in healthcare and the drug supply chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2.4\tTEXT EMBEDDINGS, SIMILARITY METHODS & ML FOR SUBSTITUTION**\n",
        "In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence for analysing medical and drug-related text has grown very quickly. One important method in this area is text embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Kauffman et al. (2025), text embedding means turning written text into numbers so that a computer can understand the meaning in a simple way.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a text is converted into a numeric vector, it becomes possible to measure how similar two pieces of text are.\n",
        "\n",
        "In drug information, the text often contains many useful details, such as how the medicine works, what it is used for, and safety warnings. If these descriptions are turned into embeddings, we can see which medicines have similar meanings or similar uses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important part of this process is similarity search. After creating embeddings, we can compare medicines using methods like cosine similarity. This method shows how close two drugs are based on their numerical vectors. A higher similarity score usually means that the two medicines may work in a similar way or may be potential substitutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using similarity search is helpful for medicine substitution because it gives a more structured and objective way to find possible alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adak (2024) explains that manual decision-making is often slow and may not always be accurate, so data-driven tools can help improve the process. Other studies also use machine learning techniques such as clustering, ranking models, or classifiers. But for identifying substitute medicines, the combination of text embedding + similarity calculation is one of the simplest and most effective approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, text embeddings are combined with the structured features of each drug, such as therapeutic class and chemical class. This makes the similarity calculation more complete because it considers both the meaning of the text and the medical structure of the drug (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, embedding and similarity methods provide a strong scientific base for building systems that can suggest substitute medicines in a fast, accurate, and safer way.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2.5\tSUMMARY OF LITERATURE GAPS**\n",
        "Previous studies have explored many important topics related to drug shortages, medicine substitution, and data analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are still several gaps that show why this study is needed and how it adds something new to the field.\n",
        "\n",
        "**First gap:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many studies focus on only one part of the problem. For example, some papers mainly discuss the causes and impacts of drug shortages (Aronson et al., 2023a; Adak, 2024). Other studies look only at how pharmacies choose substitute medicines (Andy & Andy, 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are not many studies that look at both shortage and substitution together in a connected way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Second gap:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Most current substitution tools are old and mostly manual. They often check only the active ingredient and do not consider other important elements such as chemical structure, mechanism of action, or therapeutic class (Andy & Andy, 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of this, the suggested substitutes may not always be the best or safest options.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Third gap:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Some studies use machine learning, but they usually focus on other tasks such as predicting demand or classifying diseases. There are very few studies that combine text embeddings with structured drug features to identify substitute medicines (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fourth gap:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In many earlier works, model evaluation is limited. Standard metrics such as **Hit@k** or **Precision@k** are rarely used. Without these metrics, it is difficult to know how good or reliable the suggestions really are.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fifth gap:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many studies about drug shortages remain theoretical and do not give practical tools for managers.\n",
        "Iyer (2025) explains that data-driven systems should support real decisions, but many research papers do not turn their results into something useful for daily work.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How this study fills the gaps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This dissertation addresses these gaps by:\n",

        "## **3.1\tSTAKEHOLDERS & DECISION CONTEXT**\n",
        "\n",
        "In drug shortages and medicine substitution, several groups are involved. These groups are called stakeholders, and each of them has different needs. According to Adak (2024), a good data-driven system should support all of these groups in their daily decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pharmacists**\n",
        "\n",
        "Pharmacists work directly with patients. When a medicine is not available, they need fast and clear information about the possible substitutes. For them, the most important factors are speed and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Doctors**\n",
        "\n",
        "Doctors want to make sure that a substitute medicine is safe and has a similar effect to the original one. They pay attention to things like side effects, therapeutic class, and how the medicine works in the body.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Supply and distribution companies**\n",
        "\n",
        "These organisations need to understand which drug groups are more sensitive to shortages. Andy and Andy (2023) explain that this information helps them plan stock, orders, and logistics more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Health managers**\n",
        "\n",
        "Drug and treatment managers are responsible for the overall functioning of the treatment system. They look at indicators such as shortage risk, substitutability, and inventory levels. Data-driven tools can support them by offering a clearer picture of the situation (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because each stakeholder has different needs, a medicine substitution system must give useful and reliable information to all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps make decisions faster and improves the quality of care.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3.2\tMANAGERIAL KPIS**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the pharmaceutical supply chain, managers use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to understand the situation of each medicine and to make better decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Iyer (2025), clear and measurable indicators are important for good planning, especially when there is a risk of shortage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, two main KPIs are introduced. These indicators help managers understand how easy it is to replace a medicine and how high the shortage risk might be.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1) Substitutability Index (SI)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Substitutability Index shows how many good substitute options a medicine has.\n",
        "\n",
        "SI is calculated from the similarity scores between the target medicine and other medicines. A high SI means that the medicine has several strong alternatives. This makes the work of pharmacists and doctors easier because they can choose another medicine if the main one is not available.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Shortage Risk Index (SRI)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Shortage Risk Index shows how vulnerable a medicine is to shortages. If a medicine has a low SI (few substitutes), then its SRI becomes higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "Andy and Andy (2023) note that identifying high-risk medicines helps organisations plan their stock, imports, and purchasing more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Managerial importance**\n",
        "\n",
        "With SI and SRI, managers can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- identify sensitive drug groups,\n",
        "\n",
        "- plan inventory more accurately,\n",
        "\n",
        "- allocate resources to high-risk medicines,\n",
        "\n",
        "- and decide which products need faster purchasing or import.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, SI and SRI are simple but practical tools that can support prediction, planning, and shortage management in healthcare systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3.3\tBUSINESS USE CASES IN DRUG SHORTAGE**\n",
        "\n",
        "When a specific medicine becomes unavailable, each part of the healthcare system has a different role. The process usually begins at the level of health managers and supply organisations. By using the SI and SRI indicators, which come from the data-driven model developed in this study, they can identify high-risk medicines and set priorities for purchasing, importing, or stocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "These indicators help them see the shortage risk more clearly and support better planning. After this first step, pharmacists play their role. The model suggests a list of possible substitute medicines based on similarity scores. The pharmacist then reviews these suggestions using their professional knowledge and decides which option is scientifically safe and acceptable. In this way, the model acts as an initial recommendation tool, while the final practical decision belongs to the pharmacist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the treating doctor makes the clinical decision. The doctor uses the information produced by the model—such as therapeutic similarity, mechanism of action, and drug class—but the final choice depends on the patient’s medical condition and personal factors. This ensures that the model supports the doctor’s judgment rather than replacing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This scenario shows that the proposed model can be used in a real decision-making chain, from management to pharmacy to clinical care. It is not only a technical idea but a practical tool that can help when medicines are in short supply.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3.4\tSUCCESS CRITERIA & VALUE CREATION**\n",
        "\n",
        "For a data-driven system to be useful during medicine shortages, it must meet several key criteria.\n",
        "These criteria show whether the model can support real decisions or whether it remains only a theoretical idea.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1) Accuracy of substitute suggestions**\n",
        "\n",
        "One important success factor is the accuracy of the suggested substitute medicines. If the similarity scores are not calculated correctly, the recommendations will not be helpful. The accuracy can be checked through the SI indicator and with evaluation metrics such as Hit@k.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Speed of the system**\n",
        "\n",
        "During shortages, time is very important. A model that gives results quickly has higher value for pharmacists and managers who need to make fast decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) Usability for different stakeholders**\n",
        "\n",
        "The information produced by the model must be easy to understand and useful for all stakeholders from managers to doctors. Iyer (2025) notes that data-driven tools create value only when they are simple enough to use in daily work.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4) Value created for the healthcare system**\n",
        "\n",
        "The model can create value in several areas:\n",
        "\n",
        "- reducing the time needed for decision-making,\n",
        "- lowering the risk of choosing an unsuitable substitute,\n",
        "- supporting stock and purchasing decisions,\n",
        "- and helping to prevent severe shortages.\n",
        "\n",
        "These points show that the proposed system can be a practical tool for improving how drug shortages are managed.\n",
