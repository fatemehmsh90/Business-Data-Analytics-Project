        "## 1.1\tBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n",
        "Drug shortage is an important problem in the world.\n",
        "When a medicine is not available in the market, patients and doctors need to find a substitute drug.\n",
        "This process is often slow and manual, and people usually look only at the active ingredient.\n",
        "However, this is not enough because medicines can be different in their chemical structure, mechanism of action, and therapeutic class.\n",
        "If these differences are not considered, the chosen substitute may not work well and can cause treatment delays or higher costs (Aronson et al., 2023a; Aronson et al., 2023b).\n",
        "There are many reasons for drug shortages, such as production problems, dependency on one manufacturer, and weak distribution systems.\n",
        "These problems hurt patients and put pressure on the healthcare system (Andy A. and Andy D., 2023).\n",
        "In recent years, data-driven approaches have been used more often to support decision-making.\n",
        "Using data science and combining it with artificial intelligence, these methods can find patterns faster and help select better substitutes (Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "For text information about drugs, embedding methods can also be used to understand meaning and measure similarity between medicines (Kauffman et al., 2025).\n",
        "This study aims to build a data-driven approach for identifying substitute medicines. This study try to combine textual and structural features to calculate similarities and provide results that can help pharmaceutical supply company managers make better and faster decisions. (Aronson et al., 2023b; Iyer, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Problem Statement *(~150 words)*\n",
        "[Clearly define the main problem: the absence of a data-driven system for identifying substitute drugs based on both textual and structured attributes. Highlight the need for a faster and more transparent analytical approach.]\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Research Aim & Objectives *(~120 words)*\n",
        "**Aim:**  \n",
        "To develop a data-driven approach for identifying substitute drugs and analyzing risk in the pharmaceutical supply chain.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Objectives:**  \n",
        "- Generate text embeddings and integrate them with structured features  \n",
        "- Compute similarity and extract Top-k substitute drugs  \n",
        "- Perform clustering and build substitution networks  \n",
        "- Design and calculate SI (Substitutability Index) and SRI (Shortage Risk Index)  \n",
        "- Validate results using an external reference dataset  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 Research Questions *(~100 words)*\n",
        "- RQ1: Does combining textual and structured features improve the accuracy of drug substitution?  \n",
        "- RQ2: Which therapeutic classes show the highest and lowest internal substitutability?  \n",
        "- RQ3: How do the SI and SRI indices represent the risk level in different drug groups?  \n",
        "- RQ4: How can the analytical results support procurement and supply chain decision-making?\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.5 Scope & Significance *(~150 words)*\n",
        "[Scope: use of the Mendeley MID dataset and external validation dataset.  \n",
        "Significance: support data-driven decision-making to reduce delays, improve supply chain efficiency, and assist healthcare professionals and procurement officers in choosing alternative medicines.]\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.6 Overview of Analytical Approach *(~150 words)*\n",
        "[General workflow: EDA → Text Embedding → Structured Feature Encoding → Integration → Similarity Computation → Clustering/Network → Evaluation → Business Insight Generation.]\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.7 Structure of the Dissertation *(~80 words)*\n",
        "[Provide a short overview of chapters 2 to 9, summarizing how each chapter contributes to achieving the research objectives and how the analysis progresses from theory to implementation and business interpretation.]\n"
